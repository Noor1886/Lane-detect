# Lane Detection 
## Image Prepossessing
The following operations were performed before lane de-
tection:
1) Image undistortion using cv2.undistort.
2) Image blurring using a Gaussian kernel of size 5 Ã—5.
3) Thresholding the gray image to get a binary image.
4) Obtained ROI, which is almost 55% of the image.


## Parameters

1) BasePath - project folder 
2) ImageFilePath - absolute path of the image files
3) CamConfigFile - path where the .yml file is
4) SaveFileName - file name for the saved video. Note: this path is relative to the BasePath
